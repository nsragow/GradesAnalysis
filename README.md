# GradesAnalysis

Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
<br>
We will start with a given hypothesis, and create three others on our own.


# Todo
1. Engineer the data
2. Explore data to form three other hypotheses
3. Review our process to confirm conformity to proper experimental design
4. Select audience
5. Accept/Reject hypotheses
6. Create Jupyter-Notebook for presentation of our findings
7. Edit README to include explanation of the process, methodology and findings
8. Create presentation slides including original hypotheses, results and relevance to the audience
9. Present
